Groovy language definition for [Prism](http://prismjs.com/) the lightweight JavaScript syntax highlighter.

Check out the [demo page with tests](http://freeside.co/prism-groovy).

## Contributing

It's pretty simple to contribute:

* the language definition is in `src/prism-groovy.js`.
* syntax examples are in `index.html`.
* tests are in `test/prism-groovy.spec.js`.

If you can help improve any of those things please do.

## Running tests

To run the tests you just open `index.html` in your browser.
